Overview

This project is a Simple Calculator built using Python.
It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The goal of this project was to understand Python fundamentals like functions, conditional statements, and user input/output while building a small but useful application.

This calculator takes two numerical inputs from the user and performs the selected mathematical operation, displaying the result in the terminal.

Key Activities

Project Planning:

Decided on calculator operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide).

Designed input/output flow using Python’s input() and print() functions.

Code Implementation:

Defined separate functions for each arithmetic operation.

Implemented logic to select operations using conditional statements.

Handled division by zero using error checking.

Testing and Validation:

Tested all four operations with different inputs.

Verified correct handling of invalid inputs (like division by zero).

Documentation:

Created this README file to describe the purpose, code, and usage.
